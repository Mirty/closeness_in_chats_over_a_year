# closeness in chats over a year
This project was inspired by a piece of art I saw on ig: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs-zDD9FJOl/

How often do I chat with my contacts on Telegram? A Processing3 application that shows me. Some examples below.

The image above is a visualization about the Telegram chat with my roomate during 2018. We first met in October. The line above represents the messages I sent to her, the one below represents the frequency of her messages in our chat.
The closer the lines are to each other, the more we chatted.
